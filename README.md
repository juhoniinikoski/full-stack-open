# Full Stack open

This repository contains my solutions for the exercises in the Full Stack Open course by the University of Helsinki.

React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! The course is an introduction to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

> The solutions in this repository are not intended to be used as a cheat sheet or a substitute for doing the exercises yourself.
